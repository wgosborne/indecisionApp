react course project

This is a project that I worked on throughout part 1 of my react UDemy course by Andrew Mead. I began this application in May of 2023
and finished it at 12:20am on 11/26/23 after returning home from Thanksgiving in Brevard, NC with Morgan, Soern, and Mom. 

I worked on it when I went home for breaks and had big chunks of time at either my mom or dad's house. My favorite place to work on it was
in coffee shops although without my double monitor it was hard to watch the lecture and write the code. It sounds like the next part of 
the course is learning how to build and deploy full functioning production level applications.

My favorite places to work on it:
- Cup and Saucer, Brevard NC
- Mad Hatter or whatever it was called, Varneville SC
- I think I would have loved to work on it in peets but i dont think I ever had the oppurtunity to do so

  Key things that kept me motivated:
  - Helping Zachary pick out a Udemy course
  - Meeting with Soern's friend Don Schrishmer
  - Meeting with mom's friend Adam Fisher in his Brevard office
  - Listening to the React Round Up Podcast
  - Being a 321 TA Sponsor
 
  Challenges:
  The hardest part was when there was an issue that arose that was not discussed in the video or looked like something I had never seen
  before. I ran into a lot of issues when it came to depencencies and versioning. I think that following a video that was old made
  it harder but I liked it because it added a challenge and I totally improved my problem solving skills in regaurd to new things.
  To sokve the problem I would start by pin pointing what I understood from the error message and using the tools in my own toolbox
  to fin the line the error was on and troubleshoot. From there I would type in general things into google and try  and parse
  out meaning from people's responses to others who had erros simlar to mine, even if they were dealing with another framework or
  language. Finally, Morgan suggested that I try chatGPT (duh why didn't I even try that at first lol) and that helped me add some
  key lines to run in the command prompt to get my wheels turning (npm install, deleting and re adding, npm clear cache, etc).
  The thing I need to remember and focus on is that everything is figure-out-able and to not give up. In the beggining I would
  get so discouraged and let large amounts of time pass between hard work sessions. I learned that I don't need to get bogged down
  over stuff like that. Even the pros run into things that feeel impossible and it just takes time and focus.

  Directions to run:
  - Clone down the gitHub link
  - open a command promp and navigate into the react-course-projects folder -> indecision-app
  - run the command 'git checkout master' to switch to master
  - run 'npm install' to install all the packages in the packagge.json folder
  - run 'yarn run dev-server' to host it locally (by the end of the course I should be able to deploy it!!!! :))
