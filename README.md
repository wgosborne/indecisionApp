Clone down the gitHub link
open a command promp and navigate into the react-course-projects folder -> indecision-app
run the command 'git checkout master' to switch to master
run 'npm install' to install all the packages in the packagge.json folder
run 'yarn run dev-server' to host it locally (by the end of the course I should be able to deploy it!!!! :))
